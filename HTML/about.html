                                </h2>
                                <p class="browntext">I was born and raised in the Phoenix Valley in the state of Arizona. Growing up I loved going to school, practicing the piano and playing outside. In highschool I enjoyed learning about a variety of different subjects, my favorites being humanities, and economics. Outside of class I discovered a passion for music, especially for writing songs and performing them live. I started a band with some friends to play the songs I was writing and we ended up playing a few shows and releasing an <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3sSxFOorWlljZPEIwIg2Fx?si=4g4QnYNhRqOcKRZexJtyJw"> album</a> of our original songs. I also loved playing volleyball as an outside hitter on the highschool team.</p>
                                <p class="mb-0 browntext">
                                    After graduating highschool and a year of introductory business classes at Brigham Young University, I decided to serve a two year proselyting mission for my church. I was assigned to teach in Saltillo, Mexico and learned spanish. After 9 months of living in Mexico and learning spanish, making friends, teaching about Jesus, and loving the culture my time in Mexico was cut short by the COVID 19 pandemic. I spent some time with my family then went back out to Atlanta, Georgia to finish my two years as a missionary. In my time in Mexico and Georgia I learned valuable skills of putting other peoples' needs before my own, how to have crucial conversations, and working long hours to acheive goals.

                                <br>
                                <p class="browntext">Now I am back at BYU studying Finance and Social Impact. I have learned alot about basic finance principles from my classes. In my Social Impact Project class I was able to work with Village Capitaland help them significantly improve their investor coalitions. From that experience I learned how to tackle complex business issues with creative problem solving and analysis.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p class="browntext"> Now I'm looking forward to more opportunities to apply the skills I'm learning and solve real world business problems!</p>
